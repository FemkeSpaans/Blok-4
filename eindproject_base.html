            I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was
            To catch them is my real test
            to train them is my cause
            I will travel across the land, searching far and wide
            Teach Pokémon to understand
            the power that's inside
            Pokémon
            Gotta catch em all (It's you and me)
            I know it's my destiny, Pokémon
            Oh, you're my best friend
            In a world we must defend
            Pokémon
            Gotta catch 'em all (A heart so trueeee)
            Our courage will pull us through
            You teach me
            And I teach you
            Pokémon
            Gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all
            Pokémon

            Every challenge along the way
            With courage I will face
            I will battle everyday
            To claim my right full place
            Come with me, the time is right
            Theres no better team
            Arm and arm we`ll win the fight
            Its always been our dream
